# Three independent ecology programmes — current executable status

These are three separate ecological papers. EOG is provenance/discovery only.

## 1. Azores — phase-specific control of eel migration

### Scientific status

**Analysis closed after endpoint audit; manuscript V3 QC PASS.**

Primary evidence:

**Migration activation**
- initiation Durif OR per FIII -> FIV -> FV increment: **2.08**
- 95% CI **1.56–2.76**
- p approximately **4.2e-7**

**Behavioral onset**
- Cox HR per stage: **1.29**
- 95% CI **1.13–1.47**
- p = **0.00016**

**Post-activation progression**
- migration-speed ratio per stage: **0.983**
- 95% CI **0.852–1.134**
- p = **0.815**

Interpretation:
> capture-time silvering readiness strongly predicts whether and when migration becomes behaviorally active, whereas the same Durif-stage gradient is absent from generic post-activation migration speed.

### Endpoint-audit boundary

The upstream terminal-positive file is **not** a validated binary success/failure variable.

Therefore:
- terminal-set OR **1.15** is secondary sensitivity only;
- former initiation/terminal OR-ratio **1.81** is secondary sensitivity only;
- non-membership must not be called biological migration failure;
- no escapement probability is estimated in this reanalysis.

Canonical interpretation:
- `results/phase_control_canonical_v2.json`
- `docs/escapement_endpoint_audit.md`
- `docs/CLAIM_EVIDENCE_MAP_PHASE_CONTROL_V2.md`

### Manuscript status

Submission-canonical biological draft:
- `manuscript/AZORES_PHASE_CONTROL_MANUSCRIPT_V3.md`

Numeric contract:
- `manuscript/MANUSCRIPT_NUMERIC_CONTRACT_V2.json`

QC:
- `manuscript/MANUSCRIPT_QC_V2.json`
- status: **PASS**
- all primary counts/numbers present;
- threshold-defined onset clock present;
- terminal endpoint explicitly sensitivity-only;
- no terminal non-membership = failure claim;
- no EOG wording in biological manuscript;
- required core references present.

### Remaining non-scientific submission inputs

- author/affiliation/contribution fields;
- target-journal formatting;
- final figure rendering under the V3 figure contract;
- source-study ethics wording check;
- submission release/archive.

**No new exploratory Azores analysis is required.**

## 2. Louisiana — hydrological buffering inside resident home ranges

### Scientific status

**Analysis closed for drafting.**

Primary independent Lake Erie result:
- **190** valid matched events;
- **10** birds;
- **10/10** positive SRI;
- median SRI **0.886**;
- exact sign-test p **0.00098**.

Temporal retention:
- 10/10 positive;
- median **0.658**.

Availability coupling:
- observed slope **0.162**;
- pseudo-used null median **1.001**;
- coupling reduction **83.8%**;
- 10/10 birds below own null median.

Buffering limit:
- **9/10** retain positive buffering under top-quartile local mismatch;
- median extreme retention **0.629**.

Interpretation:
> repeated realised microhabitat use strongly dampens temporal hydrological variation experienced by resident King Rails relative to local time-matched availability.

Boundary:
- coordinate-to-event join remains unresolved;
- do not claim measured geographic displacement caused the buffering.

### Manuscript status

Canonical manuscript:
- `manuscript/LOUIS_HYDROLOGICAL_BUFFERING_MANUSCRIPT_V1.md`

Numeric contract:
- `manuscript/MANUSCRIPT_NUMERIC_CONTRACT_V1.json`

Submission QC:
- logical equivalent of `validation/validate_manuscript_v1.py`: **PASS**
- no control-character / LaTeX corruption;
- all canonical sample-flow and SRI/coupling values present;
- coordinate-linkage boundary explicit;
- no EOG wording;
- no forbidden causal claims;
- Brewer source citation, Zenodo DOI and References section present.

### Remaining non-scientific submission inputs

- author/affiliation/contribution fields;
- target-journal formatting;
- final figure rendering from canonical outputs;
- source ethics wording verification;
- submission release/archive.

**No further Lake Erie post-hoc metric is required unless authoritative coordinate-event linkage appears.**

## 3. Tampa — buffered persistence under quantitative degradation

### Scientific status

Retrospective ecology is closed.

Supported:
- recorded occurrence can remain stable while frequency, abundance, blade length, shoot density or composition deteriorate;
- external Zostera panel reproduces broad binary–quantitative state decoupling.

Mechanism remains prospective.

### Decisive prospective test

**Four-bay rhizome TNC first.**

Planning frame:
- Old Tampa Bay: 8 recent positive nodes
- Middle Tampa Bay: 11
- Lower Tampa Bay: 14
- Boca Ciega Bay: 8
- planning total: **41**

Confirmatory gate:
- >=36 analyzable nodes total;
- >=6 analyzable nodes per bay;
- >=3 valid cores/node;
- one <=28-day campaign;
- paired baseline within +/-14 days;
- one frozen HPLC workflow.

Primary model is already frozen.

### Software/readiness status

Authoritative pilot path:

~~~text
raw response-independent pilot records
 -> validation/build_tnc_v2_method_pilot_summary.py
 -> field/tnc_v2_method_pilot_candidate.json
 -> validation/validate_tnc_v2_method_pilot.py
 -> PASS_METHOD_PILOT
 -> apply selected values to field/tnc_v2_precollection_freeze.json
 -> validation/validate_tnc_v2_baseline.py
~~~

The following templates already exist:
- `field/tnc_v2_raw_pilot_metadata.json`
- `field/tnc_v2_hplc_matrix_pilot.json`
- `field/tnc_v2_tissue_class_pilot.csv`
- `field/tnc_v2_core_geometry_pilot.csv`
- `field/tnc_v2_offset_pilot.csv`
- `field/tnc_v2_preservation_pilot.csv`

### Current hard stop

**STOP_RESOURCE_FREEZE_INCOMPLETE**

The unresolved values are physical field/laboratory facts, not analytical choices:

1. campaign start date;
2. campaign end date;
3. selected horizontal-rhizome tissue class;
4. minimum perpendicular transect offset;
5. selected core diameter;
6. selected core depth;
7. maximum collection-to-preservation time;
8. preservation method;
9. final four-bay node/date/resource manifests;
10. optional forcing modules must be explicitly confirmatory or disabled.

These values cannot be inferred from existing retrospective data and must not be fabricated.

### Single next external input

The next scientifically valid input is:

> **response-independent TNC method/field pilot measurements entered into the existing pilot files.**

Once those values exist, the repository already contains the builder, validator and fail-closed transition into the outcome-bearing four-bay campaign.

# Active order

1. **Azores:** manuscript scientifically QC-passed; submission formatting only.
2. **Louisiana:** manuscript scientifically QC-passed; submission formatting only.
3. **Tampa:** active science blocker is the physical TNC method/field pilot.

## Hard boundary

Do not restart exploratory analyses in Azores or Louisiana merely because Tampa is waiting on external field/laboratory input.

The target remains three independent ecological papers.
